/**
   @mainpage Template doxygen docs for simclasses



   @author F. Izzy Cyst <icyst@milky.way>

   @section Overview

   This is a template overview document for the project simclasses.
   You should customize these documents.

   The build system will also build documentation from the source
   files themselves.

   If you "make doxygen", you will find the generated html in 
   $I3_WORK/docs/simclasses

   @todo Add examples of syntax highlighting and doxygen features.
